# Delhi_Climate_Trend_Analysis
A complete end-to-end climate analysis project exploring temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure trends using Excel, SQL, and Power BI.

## Overview
This project analyzes daily climate data to uncover seasonal patterns, annual variations, extremes, and relationships among key weather variables.
The analysis moves through a full data pipeline:
Excel (cleaning) → SQL (analysis) → Power BI (visual storytelling)

The final output is a three-page interactive dashboard that explains how temperature, humidity, wind, and pressure behave throughout the year.
